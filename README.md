# dbt-Snowflake-Airflow-ETL-pipeline
 In this project, I take you through building an ELT pipeline with dbt, Snowflake, and Airflow, showing you the ropes on data modeling and system orchestration. We'll dive into setting up fact tables and data marts, and get a handle on Snowflake's RBAC to really boost your data engineering toolkit.
